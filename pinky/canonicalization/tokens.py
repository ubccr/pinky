SmilesTokens

This is a list of smiles tokens that define the smiles language.
There are for types of tokens

 Atoms - C or [1000C]
 Bonds - single, double, sacrifice fly
 closures - things like C1CCC1 (the ones are closures)
 branches (Branch Start, Branch End)
          - these are ( and ) respectively

 Each Token Class below can convert the appropriate object into
 a string through overloading the __str__ mechanism.

# Canonical labeling rules for daylight atoms
# From the Daylight Theory Manual
# Organic subset atoms may be written without brackets if the number of
# attached hydrogens conforms to the lowest normal valence consistent
# with explicit bonds. "Lowest normal valences" are B (3), C (4),
# N (3,5), O (2), P (3,5), S (2,4,6), and 1 for the halogens.
# Atoms in aromatic rings are specified by lower case letters, e.g.,
# aliphatic carbon is represented by the capital letter C, aromatic
# carbon by lower case c.
